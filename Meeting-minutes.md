- **Attendees:** Everyone

### Agenda

- Discuss the contents of the assignment specification
- Create a Github repository to store any work
- Allocate data analysis work and figure out a due date

### Meeting notes

- Data exploration seems easy; seems best to do the analysis for both `P_t` and `y_t`
- Data exploration can be in any language you want
- Not sure how to implement MCMC for this problem
